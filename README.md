# Social-Media-Project
CS 180 Project 5, Option 2
Project Requirements: 
CORE
The application must support simultaneous use by multiple users over a network. Changes to profiles and friend requests should appear in real-time as users add them. 
All user interactions must be GUI based. 
Data must persist regardless of whether or not a user is connected. If a user disconnects and reconnects, their data should still be present. 
Descriptive errors should appear as appropriate. The application should not crash under any circumstances. 
Users can create, edit, and delete accounts for themselves.
The attributes you collect as part of account creation are up to you. 
Users should be required to either create an account or sign in before gaining access to the application. 
Whichever identifier you maintain for the user must be unique. 
Users can create, edit, and delete profiles.
Remember to restrict edit and delete access to the user who created the profiles.
 A profile should contain a minimum of contact information, likes / interests, a friends list, and "about me". 
Users can create a friends list of other users of the application. 
To be friends, both users must have an account. One user must send a friend request to another. No confirmation is required. 
SELECTIONS
Users can import or export profiles using a csv file.
All profile details should be preserved: contact information, likes / interests, a friends list, and "about me" (other details if necessary). 
Update the friend request functionality to prevent automatic friending. Users can see a list of their sent and received friend requests. They can rescind friend requests or confirm them. 
If a friend request is rescinded, it will no longer appear for the recipient or the sender. 
If a friend request is confirmed, it will no longer appear for the recipient or the sender. Both users will be added to each other's friend list. 
Users can view a list of all the application's users and send any given individual a friend request or view their profile. 
Optional Features: 
Indicating whether a User is online.
Adding profile photos.
Allow accounts to be set to "private", where no other user can view them, and "protected", where only current friends can view them.
